An animated navigation bar executed by pure CSS.

July 2024 Update:
    Minor design changes to navigation bar.
    Major overhaul of animations. The navigation bar now expands to show all three links, no matter where the mouse is hovering over it; This fixed the issue of the navigation bar glitching out when the mouse cursor was placed in between "sections" of the bar.
