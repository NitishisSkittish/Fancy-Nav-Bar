An animated navigation bar executed by pure CSS.

Goals:
I will attempt to create a system to customize the navigation bar (ex: adding more links, changing colors) via a frontend UI.
I think javascript may be necessary to execute this idea. If this ends up being true I will try to build the system around the existing code so that it can simply be slapped on to existing projects without requiring reworks, & so that people can still opt to use the navigation bar with only HTML & CSS with no drawbacks from not installing the javascript system.
I also aim to adapt navigation bar to mobile viewing, which is currently incompatible.

July 2024 Update:
    Minor design changes to navigation bar.
    Major overhaul of animations. The navigation bar now expands to show all three links, no matter where the mouse is hovering over it; This fixed the issue of the navigation bar glitching out when the mouse cursor was placed in between "sections" of the bar.
    Still composed of pure CSS & HTML
